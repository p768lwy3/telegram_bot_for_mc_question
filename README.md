# telegram_bot_for_mc_question
Here is a mc telegram bot, with some examples from HKDSE math.

# TODO:
0. Rewrite the game function (since I have moved from the main folder to ./bot folder...)
1. Solving the problem caused by user without username (may be to use userid instead)
2. put Non-embedded MC (or call voting generator) in beta-function to the question game generator
3. use database to save userid and username and path to pic, so on so forth.
